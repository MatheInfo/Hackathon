## A few quantitative thoughts on parking in Marburg

What is your car's favourite spare time hobby? It parks around. In this project, I investigated the parking behaviour for the case of Marburg (a city 1h from Frankfurt known for its university). The analyses comprise of a time series analysis, day-time usage of parking spots and the computation of periodicities in the parking signal with autocorrelations. Lastly, I used a Gaussian Process to predict the parking demand at locations that do not feature a parking deck - such as the university Mensa.

## Mensalysis

... was a Friday evening project to investigate the variety, pricing and ingredients of german mensa food. We set a focus on Marburg University, as we thought there was not that much of a variety. We ended up pulling the Data from OpenMensa and starting analysis, but never stepped too deep into it.

The code for pulling the data and the analysis is available in the [respective GitHub repository](https://github.com/jonashoechst/mensalysis).
